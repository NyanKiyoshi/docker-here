Either run:
- `make test`
- Or:

  1. `make shell`
  2. `poetry run pytest`

  This method avoids installing dependencies multiple times if
  you are actively developing.

## Natively Using Python

1. Install Python â‰¥ 3.12
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   $ pip install poetry
   $ poetry install
   ```
3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   $ poetry run pytest
   ```
